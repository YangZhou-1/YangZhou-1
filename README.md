### Hi Yang 👋
1. Turing Award known as the Noble Prize in the computer industry.

2. Alan kay  won the 2003 Turing Award for object-oriented programming。From this two speeches, I know he is an old man. Some pictures are  same in two speeches over 9 years.

3.   I agree with “You should never build your own tools, it’s a black hole. Speed up your ability to produce the thing that you want to do it turns out.”  Computer science is an unprecedented tool. It is a tool of the human mind. It will not only make the human more powerful, and more likely that the human mind will become the tool of this tool.

4. I disagree that Alan takes a few lines of code to show how powerful a program is, and then billions of lines of code to show how important a system is. A computer system is not an accumulation of ugly code layer. What we pursue is not just faster running speed and simpler code, but a collection of different ideas and purposes, just like the species of living things. a single goal will lock our minds.
